## Project Overview

This documentation provides a detailed explanation of the **Marketing-Campaign-Performance-Analytics** project. The primary objective was to analyze marketing data to identify underperforming ad campaigns and provide **data-driven recommendations for optimization**.

Here, I outline the projectâ€™s **purpose, data sources, methodology, and key findings**.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to:

* Analyze marketing data to assess the performance of different ad campaigns.
* Identify campaigns with poor performance and recommend discontinuation or optimization.
* Strengthen skills in **data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving** within a marketing context.

---

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is stored in the **`Data`** folder under the name `ad_campaign_data.csv`.

It includes important campaign-related fields such as:

* Impressions
* Clicks
* Costs
* Conversion rates
* Campaign details

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Handled **missing values** and **outliers**.
* Ensured **consistency and accuracy** across all columns.
* Performed **feature engineering** to generate metrics such as CTR and ROI.

### 2. Data Analysis

The analysis combined multiple tools:

* **SQL** â†’ querying and filtering raw campaign data.
* **Python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy)** â†’ manipulation, statistical checks, and visualization.
* **Excel** â†’ pivot tables and quick summaries.
* **Power BI** â†’ interactive dashboard to explore campaign performance.

### 3. Key Metrics

The performance of campaigns was measured using:

* **Click-through rate (CTR)**
* **Conversion rate (CR)**
* **Return on investment (ROI)**
* **Cost per acquisition (CPA)**

---

## Key Findings

* Several ad campaigns had **low CTR and high CPA**, making them inefficient.
* Recommended **discontinuing specific underperforming campaigns** to save costs.
* Identified campaigns with **high ROI and CTR** as candidates for scaling up.
* Built a **Power BI dashboard** to monitor campaign performance continuously.
